## Tools Used

This website uses basic HTML5 and CSS3 along with Bootstrap 5. Boostrap is a popular front-end framework for building responsive (mobile-first) websites.
Using bootstrap helped in organizing our code as well as having readily available components at our fingertips to add to our website. The bootstrap components used for this project include:  
1. Navbar 
2. Buttons
3. Bootstrap Grid System
4. Carousel
5. Card

The website also uses Google Fonts (for styling text) and Font Awesome (for icons) and icons8 (for the favicon).
